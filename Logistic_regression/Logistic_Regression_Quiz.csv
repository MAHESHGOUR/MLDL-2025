"A model predicts a probability of 0.8 for a data point belonging to class '1'. If the true class is '0', what does this prediction contribute to the log-loss?",A value close to zero.,A small positive value.,A large positive value.,A negative value.,A large positive value.
When is it appropriate to use logistic regression over other classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Decision Trees?,"When the dataset is very large and complex, with many non-linear relationships.",When interpretability of the model coefficients is important.,When the decision boundary is highly non-linear.,When the number of features is much larger than the number of observations.,When interpretability of the model coefficients is important.
"The log-odds of a positive outcome in a logistic regression model is given by the equation ln(P(Y=1)/(1−P(Y=1))) = β0 + β1x1 + ... + βnxn.

What is the primary difference between logistic regression and linear regression?,"Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm, while logistic regression is unsupervised.","Logistic regression predicts a continuous variable, and linear regression predicts a categorical variable.","Logistic regression is used for classification, and linear regression is used for regression.","Linear regression requires a sigmoid function, while logistic regression does not.","Logistic regression is used for classification, and linear regression is used for regression."
How is the performance of a logistic regression model often evaluated?,By using the R-squared value.,By calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE).,"By using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.",By visualizing the residuals.,"By using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC."
"In the context of logistic regression, what is a confusion matrix?",A matrix that shows the correlation between all independent variables.,A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.,A matrix used to store the model's coefficients.,A table that shows the p-values of each coefficient.,A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.
